# Radon Browser

A sleek, elegant-looking web browsing experience designed to meet the Fluent UI design principle with the fusion of Apple's Safari flavor—promising an intuitive and delightful user experience for your own personalized browsing experience. Built based on native UWP framework, Radon gives you a blazing fast browsing experience with minimal resource impact, even on lower end systems—ensuring convenience anywhere, anytime.

Currently under development, I'm working hard to bring this browser to life so you can enjoy delightful browsing experience with unmatched performance and control over customizations.

## Features:

- Appealing detailed Ul design aligned to the Fluent design guidelines, with fusion of Apple's Safari signature looks.

- Performant minimal resource impact on lower end hardware, thanks to the native UWP runtime for Windows 10/11 devices.

- Handful control over customizations to your browser's looks and behavior. More customization features are coming later.

- Multitasking features such as multi windowing, sidebar, AI integrations and split tabs. (Coming soon)

- Powered by WebView2 engine, based on Chromium for compatibility and performance with most modern sites. WebView1 engine implementation is planned for compatibility with legacy sites.
