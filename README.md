# Radon Browser

__RIP itzbluebxrry/radon-browser GitHub repository (2022-2024)__

**[Go to the new GitHub repository](https://github.com/imscythra/radon-browser)**

A sleek, elegant-looking web browsing experience designed to meet the Fluent UI design principle with the fusion of Apple's Safari flavorâ€”promising an intuitive and delightful user experience for your own personalized browsing experience. Built based on native UWP framework, Radon gives you a blazing fast browsing experience with minimal resource impact, even on lower end systemsâ€”ensuring convenience anywhere, anytime.

Currently under development, I'm working hard to bring this browser to life so you can enjoy delightful browsing experience with unmatched performance and control over customizations.

## Features:

- Appealing detailed Ul design aligned to the Fluent design guidelines, with fusion of Apple's Safari signature looks.

- Performant minimal resource impact on lower end hardware, thanks to the native UWP runtime for Windows 10/11 devices.

- Handful control over customizations to your browser's looks and behavior. More customization features are coming later.

- Multitasking features such as multi windowing, sidebar, AI integrations and split tabs. (Coming soon)

- Powered by WebView2 engine, based on Chromium for compatibility and performance with most modern sites. WebView1 engine implementation is planned for compatibility with legacy sites.
